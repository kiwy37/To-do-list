# To-do-list

This C# application is designed to assist users with time management. It enables users to create to-do list folders in which they can add as many tasks as needed, including nested to-do lists. Users can assign a status, category, priority, and deadline to each task, and sort and view them accordingly. Additionally, the app includes search functionality for tasks by name or deadline. The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
